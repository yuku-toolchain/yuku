Very fast & spec-compliant JavaScript/TypeScript parser in pure Zig.

<br />

</div>

:::note
Yuku's JavaScript/JSX parser is already functional, well-tested. TypeScript support is still in development. Additionally, to facilitate clean public use of Yuku's parsers, a Visitor/Traverse API is on the way, featuring comprehensive scope information, symbol tables, and more.
